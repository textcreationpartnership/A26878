            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>NOw methinks you begin to ſmell a <hi>Parliament;</hi> it will not be long, I believe, before they will have another laſh at your Backs; your Impeachment is paſt, and nothing remains but your Tryal, how well you are prepared for it, the Pope and your own Conſciences can tell: You have ſeen the Succeſs of your poor Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Stafford;</hi> no Proofs were ſufficient to Convince him, nor no Arguments ſtrong enough to Perſwade him from dying a ſuppoſed Martyr: the Pope may well boaſt of his Fidelity, for he Seal'd his Death with his precious Blood, and choak't his Conſcience, its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, with a Lye; no Art could work a Contrition in him; the Advice of the Prieſts and Jeſuits ſtuck to him like Bird-Lime, and hardned him like the nether Milſtone; He was Canon proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Advice, and choſe rather to give both Soul and Body, Reputation and Honour to the Pope's Service, than one Grain of Confeſſion to the World; He was certainly as ſtrong a Pillar as ever ſupported the Plot: though he reel'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd a little to the Lords, yet he made you a ſufficient Recompence at the Hour of Death: With what Fire or with what Liquor you tempered this Steel ſo hardly, I know not; but its moſt certain, the Devil himſelf could have done no more than he did at his dying Hour; for which in <hi>Rome, France</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> he may well be dignified with the Title of Saint <hi>Stafford:</hi> But ah! methinks he meets but with a bad Requital for his Conſtancy to you, and his Infidelity to his own Soul; I am afraid he is now heard to Curſe his Nine-Pin Companions for his Zeal to the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea; now he ſees the Prieſts with other Eyes than he did before; ſince he ſwallowed the forbidden Fruit his Eyes are open; and now, I doubt, he Roars and Howles at the remembrance of that laſt loſt Hour upon Tower-Hill; its well if he has not taken up his Lodging in Hell, where there is room enough for all Impenitent Sinners, <hi>Faelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum;</hi> Happy may it be for you, if you lay his Miſery to Heart,
<pb facs="tcp:106597:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 34 -->
I hope none of you will be ſo in love with Hell (as cold Weather as now it is) as to take the ſame meaſures, to dye the ſame Death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the ſame Lyes which he did; I hope God has not left you all to the hardneſs of your own Hearts; it would be a hard caſe, if none of you ſhould have Senſe, Honeſty and Repentance; methinks ſome of you ſhould have the Fears of Death, the Terrors of Hell, and the Pangs of an evil Conſcience upon you; its ſtrange to ſee ſo many hardned Villains part with their Lives and their Souls upon ſuch eaſie terms, as good <hi>Proteſtants</hi> believe <hi>Jack Ketch</hi> has been an Eye Witneſs to. How can you think that God will be mock'd with ſuch a ſeeming ſhew of Repentance, with ſuch a ſuperficial Confeſſion, as theirs have been, who have left their Speeches as Witneſſes of their Wickedneſs? Oh! do not flatter your ſelves with ſuch a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of ſuch Pernicious Foot-ſteps; you are yet on this ſide of the Grave, and Death and Hell are at ſome diſtance from you; you have yet an opportunity to do good, and be good, to ſave your Lives, and to ſave your Souls; Oh! do not trifle away ſuch a bleſt opportunity. All the Miſchief that has enſued, or may enſue upon <hi>Stafford's</hi> denyal, will certainly be placed upon his account; he will be ſeverely dealt with for thoſe Lyes at his laſt Breath. You may poſſibly blind the World, but you cannot draw a deceitful Curtain between God's Eyes and your Sins; he ſees your Hearts and knows your Wayes; How can you be ſenſible of it, and yet perſiſt in your Wickedneſs? Lend an Ear to Conſcience, it will teach you better things then ever you yet learned from any of your Ghoſtly Fathers; it will teach you to unbowel your ſelves of all your burthenſome Sins to God, in an Unfeigned manner; it will make you diſgorge your ſelves of your Plots, and ingage you to Plot for your Souls ſafety, and your Body's ſecurity: Do not imitate thoſe who rather chuſe to go to Hell with a Plot in their Hearts, than divulge it: Think it not a ſhame to be eas'd of ſo ſhameful a Religion, as requires your Secrecy to your Eternal Deſtruction: Let not the Prieſts Hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink you, or Blind-fold you, and then lead you to Hell; God has given you time and means to Work out your Deliverance here, and your Salvation hereafter; Oh! Wo be to you if you neglect ſo great Salvation: The dividing your Heads from your Bodies is an eaſie Puniſhment, but the dividing your Souls from God is unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for who can dwell with devouring Fire? Who can dwell with everlaſting Burnings?</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, <hi>My Lords,</hi> ſpread Death and Hell before you; look a little beyond the Grave; have ſome Serious Thoughts of the condition they are in, who, we believe, were Brethren with you in Iniquity; and then I doubt not, but it will work a Reformation in you.</p>
